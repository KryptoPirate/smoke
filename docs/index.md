# Smoke

## Description
Smoke is a project with the goal to automate and configure the installation of various [GOG.com](https://gog.com) games on a ChromeOS device.  The project works by calling a series of automated tasks through a tool called [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com) to configure the Linux Development Environment (LDE) of a Chromebook to a known working state for the selected game.  Start by reading the [[Getting Started]], then check out the [[Supported Games]] for the final steps to get your specific game running.

## Features

* **Ready to run games**.  All attempts are made to configure the games to run optimally on your Chromebook, often with modern or tweaked keyboard configurations to get your playing as quickly as possible.
* **ChromeOS Support**.  Smoke is designed to run on ChromeOS hardware, bringing support to some much beloved games to your Chromebook.
* **No Launcher Software**.  Install the game and play the game.  All the supported games will show up in the built-in Chrome App launcher, there is no additional software that tries to manage your library for you.
* **Optimized Versions**.  When available, a more recent open-source port of the game engine will be installed to replace the old engine for improved user experience.
