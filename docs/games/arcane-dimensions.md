# Arcane Dimensions

    The most ambitious Quake map mod in existance.  Arcane Dimensions features the largest maps you will find running on the Quake ports, so large in fact that modifications to the Quake engines had to be implemented to fit some of these maps.  Filled with nearly as many secrets as monsters, this mod encourages exploration as much as the fast paced action.
