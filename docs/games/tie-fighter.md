# Star Wars: Tie Fighter Special Edition

!!! Quote ""

    Tie fighter puts you in the middle of the fight of the rebels against The Empire, but you're fighting for The Empire this time.  With a top-notch energy management system, objectives that change mid-mission, and bonus objectives that get you into Emperor Palpatine's Secret Order, Tie Fighter sets the bar against which all other space sims are measured.
