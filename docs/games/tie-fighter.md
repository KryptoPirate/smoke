# Star Wars: Tie Fighter Special Edition

## Game Details

!!! Tip ""
    Tie fighter puts you in the middle of the fight of the rebels against The Empire, but you're fighting for The Empire this time.  With a top-notch energy management system, objectives that change mid-mission, and bonus objectives that get you into Emperor Palpatine's Secret Order, Tie Fighter sets the bar against which all other space sims are measured.
