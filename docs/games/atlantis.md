# Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis

!!! Quote ""

    Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis stands out as an example of how an adventure game should be made.  With multiple paths to complete the game, adding a ton of replay value.  A plot better than any of the movies, and some of the best puzzles in the whole genre.  A well used licensed game.
