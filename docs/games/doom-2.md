!!! Tip ""
    The 2 in Doom 2 stands for the number of barrels on the shotgun.  With bigger levels, new enemies, and the ever loved double barrel shotgun - also called the super shotgun - Doom 2 takes everything from the original Doom up a notch to create a unique experience closely tied to the original game.
