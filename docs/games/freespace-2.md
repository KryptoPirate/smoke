# Freespace 2

!!! Quote ""

    One of the most solid space fighter simulation game ever made.  Freespace 2 is a culmination of all that was great about the space sims of the 90s with a complex ship mechanics system which uses nearly every key on the keyboard and a gripping and well paced story told throug mission briefings and in game chatter.
