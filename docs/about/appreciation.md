# Appreciation

Smoke only exists because there is a large community of individuals who pour their love and passion for video games into helping others getting their games to run.  Whether they work to bring classic games to the masses, write programs and scripts to get those games going, help other gamers in the community get their games running, there is a wealth of information and help out there.  This project would not be possible without their hard work and dedication.

!!! Danger "Thank you for your continued support!"

## GOG.com

GOG holds a special place for this project as they have been leading the effort at getting old games on the market legitimately for a very long time.  Their continued progress at getting these games out and their DRM-free model makes projects like this one possible.

## Open Source Projects

Ports, Emulators, and reverse-engineering efforts throughout the community are the foundation that make mosts of these games playable today.  A special nod to the passion and dedication of the folks behind these projects that make these games enjoyable on modern systems.  Far from being complete, this short list of open-source projects are the backbone of the Smoke install process.
