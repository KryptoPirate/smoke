# About

Smoke makes installing and running supported games from your GOG.com library onto your Chromebook possible and in most cases, easy.  While the tools and techniques used in this project can easily be adapted to most Linux builds, they remain focused on working with ChromeOS devices to make the experience as user friendly as possible.

## How it works

Smoke is a collection of Ansible deployments roles, variables, and playbooks to automate the installation of various GOG.com games on the Linux Development Environment (LDE) of a ChromeOS device.
